                        It is absolutely essential that you and your dog share a powerful bond,<br> built on trust, companionship and a strong connection.
 After training,<br> dogs are matched with partners through a detailed selection process<br> that caters for your individual personality, mobility needs, and <br>lifestyle.                   </p>

            <p class="apara">Dog Training Agency was created by dog enthusiasts for other dog enthusiasts,
               who want to create a welcoming stable environment for their new and old four
               -legged family members and raise them to the best of their abilities.<br>

               We love all kinds of dogs but also understand that it’s important to love your 
               dog the right way. We have accumulated enough personal experience to fully understand
                just how damaging it can be to leave your dog to its own devices and hope for the best,
                instead of investing time and effort into their development and training.<br>
                What many new pet-owners do not understand is that dogs are furry and four-legged 
                children: just like your child needs to be raised in the right way, so needs your dog.<br>
                 You cannot hope to get the loving and obedient pet that every dog food TV commercial 
                 seems to advertise unless you’re ready to invest time and effort into raising and training
                  them.</p>
